1) Install Ocaml (tested with Version 4.07.1) and OPAM (tested with Version 2.0.0)
   Suggestion: use a package manager like MacPorts or Homebrew 

   For the Mac, here are more detailed instructions:

   A) Install MacPorts (tested with Version 2.5.3) or install homebrew
   To install MacPorts, go to https://www.macports.org.

   To install Homebrew, go to https://brew.sh

   Homebrew will want to install Xcode. Xcode can be installed from the AppStore.

   B) Install OPAM

   If using MacPorts to install OPAM (allow the installation of any dependencies):

   $ sudo port install opam 

   If using homebrew to install OPAM

   $ brew install opam 

   C) Initialize OPAM (we suggest answering "y" to the questions asked; see https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html)
   and use the right version of Ocaml (package dependencies require version 4.02.3)
   
   $ opam init --comp 4.07.0

   D) Do as the previous command suggests. In particular, initialize your environment variables

   $ eval `opam config env`

   But also update ~/.profile and ~/.ocamlinit as per the previous command output. 

2) Install the following libraries (and allow all dependencies to be installed)

   $ opam install async core core_extended ocamlfind 

3) Install an editor. We suggest the use of emacs with tuareg mode for syntax highlighting.
   With MacPorts, use the following command:

   $ port install emacs-mac-app tuareg 

   You can also install textwrangler, from the AppStore.
   To get OCaml syntax highlighting, copy the file OCaml.plist (from the web) into 
   ~/Library/Application Support/Language Modules.

7) Install graphviz. With MacPorts, use the following command: (tested with Version 2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11)

   $ port install graphviz

8) Build the tool. Source files are located in 2 directories: safety-analysis/tool and
   architecture-synthesis/tool. Use -Is to specify the paths in a comma separated list.

   $ corebuild -Is safety-analysis/tool,architecture-synthesis/tool soteria.byte 

   Note that you can clean a build with the following command. (If you do, you have
   to rebuild the tool with the command above.)

   $ corebuild -clean

9) To run the examples

   Go to the examples/ directory. Execute the following command.
	
   $ ocaml <navigation_position.ml 

   Instead of navigation_position.ml, you can create your own example file.
